LED Experiments

In this project, I experimented with LEDs. In the end, my ultimate product was a 24x8 LED Matrix. By using the code provided in the finalMatrix folder, the LED Matrix can display any text, with the option of having the text scroll from right to left on the matrix. The matrix was built using shift registers and the Persistence of Vision (POV) effect.

Not only did I learn ways to control LEDs efficiently through this project, but I also taught myself advanced soldering techniques. Now I realize that designing a PCB is much more convenient than trying to wire connections manually. If need be, however, I am confident that I can wire circuits efficiently again, with my trusty soldering iron and a simple perfboard.

Please look at the finalMatrix folder to see the code for the 24x8 matrix. The _4x4 folder contains very basic code for a 4x4 matrix, albeit not enough to display anything meaningful. The lightRider folder contains code for a simple circuit displaying the power of the shift register.

For a project using the capabilities of the 24x8 LED matrix, see the git repository labeled MatrixAssistant.

Thanks to Dad for helping me design the final matrix and thanks to Mom for finding places in Korea where I successfully found the parts needed for this project.
