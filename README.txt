LED Experiments

The purpose of this project was to build a working LED Matrix. The code of the final 24x8 matrix is located inside the finalMatrix folder. This matrix is capable of displaying data that is sent to the arduino via serial.

The other folders contain working prototypes that I built before creating the final matrix.
